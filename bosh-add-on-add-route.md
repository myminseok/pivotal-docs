```

### Apply runtime config to deployment
```
bosh -d p-isolation-segment-is1-6e18f0c63108927910d4 deploy iso-manifest.yml
```

then, following artifacts are created in the deployed VM

- /var/vcap/jobs/pre-start-script/bin/pre-start
```
#!/bin/bash

CONFIG_PATH=/etc/systemd/network/10_eth1.network.d/custom-network.conf
cat > /var/vcap/jobs/pre-start-script/monit <<EOF
check file pre-start-script with path $CONFIG_PATH
  if does not exist then exec  "/var/vcap/jobs/post-deploy-script/bin/post-deploy"
  group root
EOF
```

-  /var/vcap/jobs/pre-start-script/monit
```
check file pre-start-script with path /etc/systemd/network/10_eth1.network.d/custom-network.conf
  if does not exist then exec  "/var/vcap/jobs/post-deploy-script/bin/post-deploy"
  group root
```

above  "pre-start-script" monit job will be executed if:
- vm is deployed
- vm is rebooted
- anytime the file is not exists after deployed.


- /var/vcap/monit/job/0001_pre-start-script.monitrc
```
check file pre-start-script with path /etc/systemd/network/10_eth1.network.d/custom-network.conf
  if does not exist then exec  "/var/vcap/jobs/post-deploy-script/bin/post-deploy"
  group root
```


- /var/vcap/jobs/post-deploy-script/bin/bin/post-deploy
```
#!/bin/bash
#ip route delete 10.0.0.0/8 via 192.168.40.1 dev eth1
#ip route add 10.0.0.0/8 via 192.168.40.1 dev eth1

CONFIG_PATH=/etc/systemd/network/10_eth1.network.d/custom-network.conf
DIR="$(dirname "${CONFIG_PATH}")"
rm -rf $DIR && mkdir -p $DIR
cat > $CONFIG_PATH <<EOF
[Route]
Gateway=192.168.40.1
Destination=192.1.1.0/24
GatewayOnLink=yes
EOF

systemctl restart systemd-networkd
```

### How network config is updated on bosh deployed VM.

#### initial VM config by bosh agent.
monit summary
```
Process 'bosh-dns'                  running
Process 'bosh-dns-resolvconf'       running
Process 'bosh-dns-healthcheck'      running
Process 'system-metrics-agent'      running
File 'pre-start-script'             accessible
System 'system_9debe3d9-1bf2-4db5-aea9-a5cda579daf9' running
```

default network config by bosh-agent.
```
/etc/systemd/network/10_eth0.network
/etc/systemd/network/10_eth1.network
```

/etc/systemd/network/10_eth0.network
```

#### updated VM config by monit.
and monit will create following custom network config.
